description: >-
  I developed a solution for an in-classroom Instant Messenger for my year 13
  coursework. I built a custom protocol from scratch on-top of raw websockets to
  communicate between a central server written in Python, capable of handling
  permissions, authentication, and multiple clients simultaneously, and a GUI
  client written in Java. I additionally created administration CLI tools to
  manage the users and permissions on the server.
